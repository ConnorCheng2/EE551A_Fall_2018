## COURSE DESCRIPTION

This course presents tool, techniques, algorithms, and programming techniques using the Python programming language for data intensive applications and decision making. The course formally introduces techniques to: (i) gather,(ii) store, and (iii) process large volumes of data to make informed decisions. Such techniques find applicability in many engineering application areas, including communications systems, embedded systems, smart grids, robotics, Internet, and enterprise networks, or any network where information flows and alters decision making.


## STUDENT LEARNING OUTCOMES

After successful completion of this course, students will be able toâ€¦

* program basic algorithms in Python,
* extract and analyze data in Python,
* prepare for their future career in Technology related fields.
